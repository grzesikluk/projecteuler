Find the minimal path sum, in matrix.txt (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."), a 31K text file containing a 80 by 80 matrix, from the top left to the bottom right by moving left, right, up, and down.

#### Solution

Probably the solution is similar to Problem 81 - 82. Need to check.

##### Possible approaches
* Dijkstra's algo
* A* algo

##### First attempt
We will try with Dijkstra.

* reading of table,
* convert table to graph,
* implement algo
