### Problem 94 Almost equilateral triangles

#### Description
It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).

#### Solution

##### Ideas
* generate Heronian triangles (have integer area and perimeter) HT
* check if HT is an almost equillateral triangle
* if yes add it to solution table
* dont' need to calculate area!

#### Problems 
* Heronian isosceles do not generate all almost-equilateral triangles (!)
