Any positive integer can be written as a product of prime powers: p1^a1 × p2^a2 × ... × pk^ak,
where pi are distinct prime integers, ai > 0 and pi < pj if i < j.

A decreasing prime power positive integer is one for which ai ≥ aj if i < j.
For example, 1, 2, 15=3×5, 360=2^3×3^2×5 and 1000=2^3×5^3 are decreasing prime power integers.

Let C(n) be the count of decreasing prime power positive integers not exceeding n.
C(100) = 94 since all positive integers not exceeding 100 have decreasing prime powers except 18, 50, 54, 75, 90 and 98.
You are given C(10^6) = 922052.

Find C(10^13).
