# projecteuler
This is repository of my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions. It started some time ago and is updated unregularly basing on my spare time and my inventions. Sometimes it takes weeks to finish the problem, sometimes it takes some time to optimise it so that it produces results in decent time.

Please do not use it for gaining fast solutions and workaround the efford needed - remember that PE is fun and motivation to discover math world.


There are many pages to start looking into problems solutions, algorithms and math ideas behind. I strongly encourage you to deep dive before looking into solutions.

Remember that many of the problems are not perfectly solved - keep that in mind. This is because all of them are solved by myself, that means sometimes the code is clumsy and unperfect, done in interative way.
